The Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction App is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in predicting the likelihood of a breast cancer recurrence. This app levereages patient data and advanced predictive models in order for the app to support clinical decision-making and personalized treatment planning.
This app contains the following steps: 
1. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, scales numerical values, and encodes categorical variables to prepare patient data for analysis.
2. Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning models to predict cancer recurrence with high accuracy.
3. Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key factors contributing to recurrence risk for accurate results.
4. Visualization Tools: In order to help understnad model predictions the following visualization tools were used; partial dependence plots and bee swarm plots.
